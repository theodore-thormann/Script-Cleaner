# Script-Cleaner
Seeks to Clean Movie Scripts for use in Text Analysis

As of this iteration there is only one function, but I seek to build more. Currently I have a script that goes through .txt film scripts and gets character names and scene headings from the scripts.

Right now the biggest goal is removing onomatopoeia from the character list and expanding the regex in the scene heading function to expand to more script formats.
